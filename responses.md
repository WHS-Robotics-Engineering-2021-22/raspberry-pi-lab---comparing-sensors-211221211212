The limits switch is a Passive Sensors and can be use to if something is press on it or hit something.
Ultrasonic Sensor is a Exteroceptive Sensors and it can be use to have far away an object is. 
Humiture Sensor can be use as a Proprioceptive Sensors to see the robot inside temperutre or as Exteroceptive Sensors to see the out side temperture.

1. What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environmnet? Sensor and coding have to be add for the rasparriery pie to sence
it envorment.

2.What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors? Cahnge in weather can or damage can influence the performance 
of these sensors.

3.What role does coding play in this process? Coding what make the  Rasberry pi able to read and use the sensors.
